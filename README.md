# NightLink

NightLink is a personal, open-source game engine, built for Neon Hour, the 80s action thriller and GURPS Tabletop RPG. It is tailor-made for my current set of 10 players, and will serve as a map display, music player, dice roller and animation medium, to bring the abstract theatre of the mind to life.

# Core Pillars

- NightLink is _open source_, which means that the engine, the assets, and the game code will be free, visible and open to use in other people's projects.

- NightLink will be a _low trust_ engine. What this means is that security can not be guaranteed: user authentication, information safety and information reliability are not in scope. As a result, this engine will be published over the web to avoid potential malware risk, hosted via a web browser. User sessions will be given through an invite code as opposed to login, and notes + secrets will HIGHLY be reccomended to be saved in Discord or personal note taking devices.

- NightLink will be _tailored_ to the current set of players. It is not built for public consumption, but private use. Therefore, the majority of work will be done to support our set of 10 players (and guests) as opposed to a general audience in need of a GURPS engine.

- Nightlink will be _cinematic_. Much of the effort will be focused on special effects, cool art, and music that drives a lightshow, as opposed to focusing on the rigorous, solid, and structrued calculator required to fully simpulate the GURPS TTRPG

A closed source, high trust, general and rigorous game engine isn't off the books in theory, but it will most likely come in the form of a different project entirely, after the lessons of NightLink have been learned. Perhaps one named NeoNight, or similar.
